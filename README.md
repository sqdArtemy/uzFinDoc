UzFinDoc - payslips translator

![logo.png](backend/media/logo.png)


## Description
The main purpose of this relatively small web-app is the creation of an efficient and accurate payslip translation application to empower users
 globally to transcend linguistic boundaries, simplify fiscal dialogue, and enhance the user experience. Our values
 are to embrace transparent discussions where all voices heard, active listening to understand diverse views and
 respect for others. We treat this project as communal effort and implement new technologies, methodologies, and
 neutral insights that may benefit Uzbek users. In developing this application, we will utilize an agile framework
 for iterative progress, ensuring code correctness and consistent translations while maintaining high-quality standards 
 through collective code reviews. The application shall translate Uzbek to English language, comprehending
 context-specific financial terms and expressions semantics. Our aspiration is an application that links all through
 efficient, precise translations with user experience optimized.
